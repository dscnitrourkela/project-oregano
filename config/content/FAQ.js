      id: 'faq-7',
      question: "What if I don't know how to code?",
      answer: "Well, in that case, here is a secret. None of the top devs at hackathons were pros when they entered their first hackathon, and we're sure you'll find beginners like you in the HackNITR 3.0 too. It's all about you wanting to learn something new about tech and grow like that.",
    },
    seven: {
      id: 'faq-8',
      question: "What if I don't present what I made?",
      answer: "We really won't advise doing that. We know you must be shy and doubtful about your work, but keep in mind that hackathons are not about being the best or making the best. Instead, it's just about what you thought and why. Your work might not even get a prize, but the feedbacks and suggestions which you'll get from showing it would really help you develop your idea or product into a cool new tech and who knows, it might be the next big thing!!!",
